Project: Placement Preparation Portal — React.js (single-page app)

Goal (one line): Build a production-ready React SPA for students to practice placement quizzes, take mock interviews, track performance, and receive tips/feedback.

Deliverables (concise):

A runnable React project scaffold (create-react-app or Vite) with folder structure and README.

Key pages/components implemented with functioning sample data and minimal styling (Tailwind or CSS modules).

Mock API layer (local JSON or simple Express stub) and example requests.

Short instructions to run, test, and extend.

Core features to implement:

Auth stub (login/logout, student role) — token can be mocked; persist in localStorage.

Routing: Home, Dashboard, Practice (quizzes), Mock Interviews, Performance, Profile, Admin panel (stub).

Practice quizzes: question list, timed quiz, submit answers, immediate scoring, show correct answers + explanations.

Mock interviews: schedule mock, interviewer prompts (text), record answers (text), save transcript.

Performance tracking: store quiz results, compute accuracy, speed, improvement trend, and show simple charts.

Tips & feedback: auto-generated feedback based on performance thresholds (e.g., "work on DS/Algo").

Admin stubs: add/edit questions, view aggregated metrics (no heavy backend).

Technical requirements:

React functional components + hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext).

React Router for navigation.

State: Context API for auth + user; keep global state minimal.

Data fetching: simulated with a mock API module that returns Promises (or a small Express server example).

Simple charting: use a lightweight chart lib or render SVG bars.

Form validation for quiz creation/profile using simple utilities.

Accessibility basics (semantic HTML, keyboard nav).

Responsive layout (mobile-first).

Unit test examples for 2 components (Jest + React Testing Library).

Clear README with run/build/test commands and explanation of where to extend backend.

Code style & constraints:

Use modern ES2020+ syntax, clear names, small components (one responsibility).

Keep each file < 300 lines.

Provide 1–2 sample questions, 1 mock user, and 1 sample quiz run in data.

Prioritize clarity and extendability over completeness.

Output format requested from AI:

Project folder tree.

package.json dependencies.

Key files fully implemented: src/main.jsx (or index.js), src/App.jsx, src/routes, src/context/AuthContext.jsx, src/components/Quiz/Quiz.jsx, src/pages/Dashboard.jsx, src/api/mockApi.js, src/data/sampleData.js, README.md.

Two unit tests (example).

Short run guide (3 commands).

Tone: deliver code + short comments only (minimal explanation). Keep output focused and copy-paste ready.
